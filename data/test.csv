Approximately 58% of the portfolio is located in existing Liberty Industrial markets, including Chicago, South Florida, Houston, New Jersey, Maryland, U.K., Central Pennsylvania, Carolinas, Minnesota, Tampa, Richmond, Arizona, Orlando and Philadelphia. These properties were 92.8% leased at the time of sale. Of the remaining approximate 10 million square feet, Liberty acquired in new market areas including; Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Columbus, Southern California, Boston, Delaware, Memphis and Seattle/Puget Sound. The acquisition was funded through a combination of sources including proceeds of $834.1 million from an offering of 24,150,000 common shares, proceeds from the offering of $450 million of 4.40% senior notes due 2024 and the assumption of nearly $230 million in mortgage debt. The company also borrowed $470 million under a unsecured term loan (""New Term Loan"") and intend to sell certain operating properties that will generate approximately $150 million in additional proceeds. A $1.27 billion bridge loan, the company entered into a commitment letter for was not needed since net proceeds from equity offering and borrowings were secured. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs & Co. served as Liberty's exclusive financial advisors on the acquisition.

Unconfirmed news reports value the deal at approximately $265,000,000.00. The property was 72% vacant at the time of sale. The buyer verified the sq. footage of the buildings but declined to speak to the exact price, deferring to the sellers. The buyer did state that the aggregate occupancy rate for the portfolio was 72% at time of sale, but that they had a tenant-in-tow for one property that raised the occupancy rate soon after closing to 84%. For purposes of the square footage calculations the buyer viewed the property at 5401 N Riverside Dr, Fort Worth, TX as being 493,368 sq. feet which is 165,324 sq. feet less than the property is currently being marketed as having available, the square footage that is associated with some mezzanine areas that may or may not remain and was thus discounted by the buyer in their purchase calculations. The true overall square footage for the portfolio is 7,804,758 sq. feet. The seller is the German-based insurance company Allianz through a US-based subsidiary Allianz Life Insurance Co. of North America. Financing was through an assumable note originally issued in July, 2010 with a balance of $160,000,000 that is to be superseded by a note of even date for $246,000,000, which once in effect will incorporate and extinguish the original note of $160,000,000 with on the $246,000,000 note remaining. The buyer viewed the transaction as meeting its stated obligations to acquire high-quality stable assets in established markets. The seller was reported as seeking to exit the ownership of such assets to concentrate on asset lending. Please note: Initial news articles erroneously reported that 20 properties had transferred.

It is worth noting that the seller was originally marketing two shovel-ready industrial sites adjacent to this building, but the buyer chose only to acquire the asset included here. It was confirmed that the property traded at a 6.44 cap rate, indicating $1,779,050 NOI at $2.95/SF annual rent. Expenses were estimated to be just over $1/SF. It was reported that the buyer calculated a cap rate of 6.25, including vacancy loss, etc., but as the tenant occupies 100% of the space, research indicates the 6.44 cap rate is a more accurate reflection of the transaction. It was stated that the seller sold as part of a larger strategy, as did the buyer, with the seller moving away from industrial assets in markets like Dallas, and the buyer focused on increasing their industrial holdings, particularly in the Dallas market. The building was delivered in 2008 and the tenant is a national credit tenant. Both of those factors made the acquisition more attractive to the buyer. Pro forma performance was not elaborated on.
