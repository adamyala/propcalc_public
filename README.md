In property tax work a property valuation takes anywhere from 4-8 hours. I felt the process was repetitive and possible to automate so I took a shot at automating it. In this demo there are two example properties that actually real warehouses in Texas. The comparable data is taken from multiple databases in March of 2014. The original goal was to pull comp data live, but for the sake of creating a demo it's just a snapshot in time.

The three major valuation methods are covered and all calculation methods are based on Marshal and Swift's handbook.
